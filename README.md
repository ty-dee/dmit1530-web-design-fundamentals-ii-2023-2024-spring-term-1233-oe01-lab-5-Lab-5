## Build Methodology 

1. After accepting the assignment from GitHub Classroom and cloning down a local copy, start by looking at the provided screenshots and figuring out what the structure of your HTML should be.

2. After creating some skeletal or structural code, begin copying and pasting the provided written content into your HTML document. 

3. After your HTML is written, make sure that it's valid.

4. Using a mobile-first approach

--- 

Take a look at the cards in the horizontal scroll wrapper. Because the copy for each of them is a slightly different length, the buttons aren't aligned very neatly. Instead of appearing at the same place on every card (at the bottom), they are staggered or ragged. 

Figure out a way to *position* these buttons so that they all appear at the same place on each card without overflowing their container or cutting off any of the written copy.
